## L1T05: Logical Programming Operators ##
This program shows the usage of Logical Programming Operators using python. It decides the award a person competing in a triathlon will receive. 

The program reads in times (in minutes) for all three events of a
triathlon, namely swimming, cycling, and running, and then calculates and
displays the total time taken to complete the triathlon.

The award a participant receives is based on the total time taken to
complete the triathlon. The qualifying time for awards is 100 minutes.
The award that the participant will receive is based on the following
criteria:

|Qualifying Criteria |Time Range|Award|
|--------------------|----------|-----|
|Within the qualifying time|0 - 100 mins|Provincial Colours|
|Within 5 mins of qualifying time|101 - 105 mins|Provincial Half Colours|
|Within 10 mins of qualifying time|106 - 110 mins|Provincial Scroll|
|More than 10 mins off from the qualifying time|111+ mins|No award|
